		<h1>Personal Manifesto</h1>
		<section id="craftsmanship">
			<h2>Crafstmanship.</h2>
			<p>
				First and foremost, I will put in the necessary work to do my task to completion
				the right way. This means learning the requisite skills, asking all of the necessary
				questions, and cutting no corners. This means attention to detail, and not just the 
				details that are easy to see.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will take pride in the work that I do; when I cannot honestly take pride in it I will
				re-do the work until I can. Each project I work on will be practice for the next and a to-do 
				list for the previous.

			<h2>Pace</h2>
			<p>
				I will take the time to do everything that must be done. I will not only focus 
				and properly do my professional work, but also the daily tasks that must
				be done to ensure happy living. I will wash dishes after I've used them, I will
				keep ahead on my laundry, and I will get oil changes in my car. That which is not
				fun &mdash; when done properly &mdash; has a tendency to leave more time for 
				that which is.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will relax. I will allow myself time to not work, and to not play. I will read &mdash;
				in a hammock &mdash; for hours at a time.

			<h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
			<p>
        There is never a point in my life where I will look at my abilities and say:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I am perfect, there is no more work to be done. 
      </blockquote>	
      <p>
        At all points of life, there will be <em>something</em> that I could improve. I will
        be able to articulaute to others what I am currently working on improving, whenever
        they ask. If I feel as though I have reached a level of sufficient mastery in a 
        particular domain, I will move on to the next; always sure to keep all of my skills
        sharp and ready.
